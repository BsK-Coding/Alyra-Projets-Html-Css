    <p class="intro">Classically trained in the art of kaiseki, Chef Sakamoto decided to leap into the world of ramen
      with his latest venture, Chotto Motto.</p>

    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>Daichi Sakamoto started cooking at age five, helping his mother prepare bentos for his father, younger sister,
      and himself. Chashu was never a missing component. Mother Sakamoto had learned how to make it when she studied
      abroad in Hong Kong. It was young Chef Sakamoto who mixed the marinade, a formula he perfected as he grew into his
      teens.</p>
    <p>Many years later, he apprenticed under famed Chef Kazue Inoue at a luxury ryokan in the Nagano prefecture. There,
      he studied the art of kaiseki for seven years, and took a particular shine to the futamono and tome-wan soup-based
      dishes. His calling was starting to simmer.</p>
